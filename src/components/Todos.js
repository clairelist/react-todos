//a TODO has:
//id, to determine which id is clicked and fetched by singular view
//title, a short clickable description of the todo, viewable here
//details, an extended description OR if null, the title of the todo again, viewable in singular todo view ONLY
// status text, clickable either IN PROGRESS, DONE, or ABANDONED
//checkbox, clickable that marks a checkmark when status is DONE or an X when ABANDONED 

//this view also has a 'create' button, that will render the CreateTodo view instead

//STRETCH goal:: create 'prerequisites' which only allow changing status to DONE when other sub-todos are marked DONE
